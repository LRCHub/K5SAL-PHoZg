Don't Let Me Go - text
Seek for a desire
Long to be higher
Unreal shadows everywhere
No, No I'm not afraid
I know my fate is in my hands

Standing on the stage alone
But everybody's gone
It's like you know that
Things are two-sided
Turn them it will show
It seems you care, you know
I don't believe

If you want me to speak
Shut the fuck up
If you want me to hear
Don't lie to me
If you want me to stay
Don't go away
If you want me to leave
Let me go

Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

All the things I built to prove
Are disappearing slowly through the air

Standing on the stage alone
But everybody's gone
It's like you know that
Things are two-sided
Turn them it will show
It seems you care, you know
I don't believe

If you want me to speak
Shut the fuck up
If you want me to hear
Don't lie to me
If you want me to stay
Don't go away
If you want me to leave
Let me go

I've been here and I've been there
I've always wanted more
People turn away from me
Maybe I've done wrong
I'm sorry for the pain
Oh, I've caused
But you've done wrong
And that's for sure

If you want me to speak
Shut the fuck up
If you want me to hear
Don't lie to me
If you want me to stay
Don't go away
If you want me to leave
Let me go

Standing on the stage alone
But everybody's gone
It's like you know that
Things are two-sided
Turn them it will show
It seems you care, you know

Standing on the stage alone
But everybody's gone
It's like you know that
Things are two-sided
Turn them it will show
It seems you care, you know
