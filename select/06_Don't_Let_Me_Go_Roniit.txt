Hey, you're brave enough to call my name
You're brave enough to come and stay
I said hey, you're brave enough to go insane
When there's nothing to say

I'll save myself
Better save myself

Don't let me go
Cuz I'll never make it
Don't let me go
I'm the best of you
Don't let me go
As I try to fake it
Don't let me go
I'm a brave soul too

Said hey you're breaking all the rules I made
You're winning all the games I play
Said hey, don't wanna be your renegade
When nobody can save me

Don't let me go
Cuz I'll never made it
Don't let me go
I'm the best of you
Don't let me go
As I try to fake it
Don't let me go
I'm a brave soul too
