Please don't never let me go
Will this one last forever
Please don't never let me go
We've only just begun
Please don't never let me go
This spell'll last forever
Please don't never let me go
The moments haunts me so

Please don't never let me go

Please don't never let me go

The moments just hide away
Up against the cliffs
The fallacy we all dream
Flowing as a stream
But as the sunshine hits us
The way you sleep out of mine
I see the magic fade
We knew that this was coming

Mh, I guess it's over
Please don't never let me go
