Christmas day is near
Family and friends all are here
I can't believe that you're still here with me
We've come through mountains of pain
Cloudy skies filled with rain
Can't wash away what christmas joy will bring
The stockings have been hung
The carols have been sung
And we're standing underneath the mistletoe
I don't deserve you but still you continue to love me
Like every december we've known
Baby hold on to me
Don't let me go
Seems like thousands of presents are under the tree
Some for you and some for me
We watch the fire make its' glow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
I reach for your hand
We touch, I shiver
You extend your lips to me
Then I realize what christmas really means
It's the joy inside my heart
And knowing that we'll never be apart
Only one thing in this world I know for sure
I don't deserve you but still you continue to love me
Like every december we've known
Baby hold on to me
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Repeat out:
What I'm gonna do
Is make the rest of my life
Like christmas time with you
Don't let me go
