don't let me go
I've already known
that each known mountain is a
representation of what we've learned
and I remember it so well
laying under the covers, pretending to sleep
you said "pretty girl don't sleep,
instead kiss me until we are dreaming of kissing.
you are so reminiscent of pink diamonds, you true beauty."
i can't stop blushing at every word he speaks
true love was foreign until he spoke to me
he keeps lighting matches when my thoughts are cloudy
don't let me go
i can't dance unless you're standing by me
you and two shots of rum give the same feeling
to my chest now so heavy
don't let me go
