Don't let me go
Said you'd be here but you left me broke
Wanna find another but I bet I don't
Don't let me go, let me know
Don't let me go
Said you'd be here but you left me broke
Wanna find another but I bet I don't
Don't let me go, let me know

Yeah, don't let me go
I could die in your arms when you hold me close
I been down since day one so count my vote
You got me locked up like Al Capone
And it's crazy coz you act shady lately
Donny on your phone, why's he calling you baby
I thought that this money would've made you stay
But what can I say I'm in love with the games you play
So baby let me play a little more
Do you love me coz I really ain't sure
1,2,3,4,5 shots deep
Now we're fighting, B why you keeping a score
And my heart says no but my mind says go
The way you move, it's just got me froze
Said I wanna find another, you said go ahead
So I left, now I'm sat writing on my jack jones, like woah

Don't let me go
Said you'd be here but you left me broke
Wanna find another but I bet I don't
Don't let me go let me know
Don't let me go
Said you'd be here but you left me broke
Wanna find another but I bet I don't
Don't let me go let me know

Now we're back to the basics
Square one it might last for a day, shit
I never know why I come back
And my boys get mad coz they know that it's whack, but
I'll keep breaking my heart to keep playing my part
I'm taking the chance, while you aim for the heart
Going back to the start, I see you holding the cards
You stayed high in the bar and I nearly died in the dark
You was crying and laughing
Like tell me what are you feeling
I see you're stuck in the past
You cut me open, I'm bleeding
When there's no rhyme to your reason
We go around like the seasons
One and another
Like we still fight when I'm dreaming
It's what we're destined to do
I should be running from you
I should be ducking and hiding and taking cover from you
You're always lying so fuck it I'm finished hiding the truth
But at the end of the day baby I'd give you the moon

Don't let me go
Said you'd be here but you left me broke
Wanna find another but I bet I don't
Don't let me go let me know
Don't let me go
Said you'd be here but you left me broke
Wanna find another but I bet I don't
Don't let me go let me know

Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Wanna find another but I bet I don't
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
