It's a game we tried, and ran out our time
It's a side of me that I cannot find

Don't let me go, don't let me go
Cause I don't want, don't want to know
Is it my fault we could not grow?

Can't take this feeling from me
Shine on bright above me
Be the light that guides me up and through the fog
You're all I know

It's a change of heart that we can't ignore
There's a part of me that will still be yours

Don't let me go, don't let me go
Cause I don't want, don't want to know
Is it my fault we could not grow?

Can't take this feeling from me
Shine on bright above me
Be the light that guides me up and through the fog
You're all I know
